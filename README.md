Currently, there are 10 astronauts in space. 7 are in the ISS spacecraft and 3 are in the Tiangong space craft. This information is published by NASA for anyone who is curious. It is titled "How Many People are in Space Right Now". [Here](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) is where I found this [data](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json).

## Fig 2: This graph shows the number of deaths in New York and North Dakota vs. time (1999-2017).

This data is published by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and can be found within a dataset that presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999. I chose to look at New York and North Dakota because they are drastically different states. Beside the obvious difference in population size, it is interesting that the number of accidental deaths in New York has significantly increased in recent years. [Here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states) is where I found this data.
